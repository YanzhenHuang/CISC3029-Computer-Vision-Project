# CISC3029 Computer Vision Project

## To run the project:
1. Make sure that you have pulled the entire repository, and make sure that you have the image processing modules installed on your MATLAB.
2. Run `Image_pyramid.m` in MATLAB to test the image pyramid.
3. Run `Hybrid_image.m` to have fun with merging two images.
